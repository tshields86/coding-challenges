### Coding Challenges

## Some daily coding challenges to hone new and existing skills

### List of challenges and short description:

- **palindrome.js**:  A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Figure out if a given number is a palindrome.

- **fibonacci.js**:  By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. Example of the sequence: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 â€¦ Figure out the Fibonacci number, which is the sum of the previous two sequence numbers.
