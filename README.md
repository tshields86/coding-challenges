### Coding Challenges

## Some daily coding challenges to hone new and existing skills

### List of challenges and short description:

- **palindrome.js**:  A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward. Figure out if a given number is a palindrome.

- **fibonacci.js**:  By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. Example of the sequence: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 â€¦ Figure out the Fibonacci number, which is the sum of the previous two sequence numbers.

- **sumConsecutives.js**:  You are given a list/array which contains only integers (positive and negative). Your job is to sum only the numbers that are the same and consecutive. The result should be one list. Ex: [1,4,4,4,0,4,3,3,1] should return [1,12,0,4,6,1]

- **evenFibSum.js**:  Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

- **primeFactors.js**:  Find all prime factors of a number.
